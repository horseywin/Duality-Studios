                <h3>A Small Team with <span class="underline">Big Dreams</span></h3>
                <p>Duality Studios is a small, Godot-powered game studio run by two teenage developers. Currently focused on platformers, the team aims to create THE game that defines their work. Although no games have been released yet, the plan is to develop paid titles for PC and Mac, driven by a commitment to high-quality games despite being an indie team.</p>

                <h3>The <span class="underline">Team</span> Behind Duality Studios</h3>
                <p>Duality Studios is run by two developers with unique skills. Fenetix, the founder and Godot master, handles all the programming and technical development. Horseywin contributes to the studio’s ideas, some game logic, and the official website, with expertise in Python automation. The two met at school and decided to team up to create games.</p>

                <h3>Team <span class="underline">Status</span></h3>
                <p>Reality Shifters is in the prototype stage, a platformer where players switch between three dimensions to progress. Platforms appear in different dimensions, and future gameplay will include mechanics like dodging enemies by shifting dimensions. Development started a few weeks ago, with Fenetix leading the game’s design while Horseywin is working on the website.</p>
